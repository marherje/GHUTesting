# GHUTesting
Originally forked from https://github.com/airqui/Chi2TestsHosotani, now outgrown into a very different thing (Not even using Chi2!).
Compare Hosotani model predictions with ILD prospects of AFBb/c at various energies, beam polarisation, PID uses, etc.

New Version using d, u, s, c, b, t flavors.

## Structure
- `include/`: Header files for the "struc" used for reading the models, the uncertainties for each scenario, and the tools used for the Testing of the models.
- `models/`: Contains .txt files with the information of the predictions for each model.
- `style/`: Configuration for plots' styling.
- `test/`: Scripts to produce the plots and some macros to run those scripts.

## Important caveat
The folder "models" needs non-public information. Contact any of the developers for it.
